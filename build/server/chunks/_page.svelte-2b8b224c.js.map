Model authors are the custodians of the data collected by their model, even if it's hosted on our platform.\n\nIf you disable data sharing in your settings, your conversations will not be used for any downstream usage (including for research or model training purposes), and they will only be stored to let you access past conversations. You can click on the Delete icon to delete any past conversation at any moment.\n\nðŸ—“ Please also consult huggingface.co's main privacy policy at <https://huggingface.co/privacy>.

You can also 1-click deploy your own instance using the [Chat UI Spaces Docker template](https://huggingface.co/new-space?template=huggingchat/chat-ui-template).\n\nWe welcome any feedback on this app: please participate to the public discussion at <https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingchat/chat-ui/discussions>\n\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingchat/chat-ui/discussions\"><img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/badges/raw/main/open-a-discussion-xl.svg\" title=\"open a discussion\"></a>\n`;\nconst Page = create_ssr_component(($$result, $$props, $$bindings, slots) => {\n  return `<div class=\"overflow-auto p-6\"><div class=\"prose mx-auto px-4 pb-24 pt-6 dark:prose-invert md:pt-12\"> <!-- HTML_TAG_START -->${marked(privacy, { gfm: true })}<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div></div>`;\n});\nexport {\n  Page as default\n};\n"],"names":[],"mappings":";;;AAGA,MAAM,OAAO,GAAG,CAAC;AACjB;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA,CAAC,CAAC;AACG,MAAC,IAAI,GAAG,oBAAoB,CAAC,CAAC,QAAQ,EAAE,OAAO,EAAE,UAAU,EAAE,KAAK,KAAK;AAC5E,EAAE,OAAO,CAAC,6HAA6H,EAAE,MAAM,CAAC,OAAO,EAAE,EAAE,GAAG,EAAE,IAAI,EAAE,CAAC,CAAC,iCAAiC,CAAC,CAAC;AAC3M,CAAC;;;;"}
